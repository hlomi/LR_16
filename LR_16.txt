Autumn is a time of change and contrasts, when nature gradually prepares for its winter rest. The leaves on the trees take on various shades, from golden to red, decorating the landscape with warm colors. The cool air brings with it a slight sadness, reminding us of the past summer. During this period, the days get shorter, and the nights cooler. Birds gather in flocks and fly south. Autumn is also filled with coziness — it’s a time for hot tea, warm blankets, and reading books by the fire. This season teaches us to appreciate the beauty in simple things and to prepare for what’s new. Autumn gives a special calm that helps us reflect on life, enjoy every moment, and understand that change is part of our journey.
